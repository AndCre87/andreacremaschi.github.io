## About my work
I am a Senior Research Fellow in Biostatistics at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), in Singapore. 

My research interests include both the methodological and applied aspects of Statistics,
particularly within the Bayesian framework.
One of my main interests is Bayesian nonparametrics (BNP), and the use of flexible mixture
models for inference in scenarios where the data present peculiar features. In my recent
works, I focus on modelling data presenting deviation from Gaussianity and a sparse
dependence structure, group-specific dependencies, as well as the flexible inclusion covariate of
mixed types in the model. Other research interests concern model-based cluster analysis, graphical models and multiple response analysis.

## ...and a little more
Work is one of my priorities - for sure - but not the only one. I like to keep myself busy with many activities. I often swim, do yoga and walk in the nature. When climate/season allows, I really like cross-country skiing (something I learnt in Norway!). For more relaxing times, I am a decent cook and enjpoy gathering herbs, berries and mushrooms.

Here are some more pictures of me:

## Research activity @ A*STAR, Singapore
The work I am conducting at A*STAR focuses on the implementation of advanced, often semi-parametric, Bayesian models to real-life data applications. In particular, I am interested in studying challenging datasets, involving mixed-type responses, covariates and time dynamics. The application of Bayesian nonparametric models to this challenging work is aimed at providing a more flexible fitting. The focus of this work is on detection of modifiable factors for early intervention, by analysisng data from large cohorts involving children and their parents. The aspects I mostly focus on are transaltional neuroscience and growth.

## PostDoc activity @ UiO, Oslo
The three PostDoc years in Oslo have been pivotal in building my research interests. There, I have been able to learn a lot about Biostatistics and real-life data applications, and often had the possibility to participate by providing useful statistical insights to the study.
In close collaboration with the Institute for Cancer Research and the Norwegian Centre for Molecular Medicine (NCMM), I focused on the analysis of dose-response data derived from cancer patients. In particular, my main project revolved around the study of drug-drug combination experiments, i.e. _in-vitro_ assays in which multiple drugs are tested simultaneously. The aim of the study is to quantify the differential effect emerging from such experiments via the specification of suitable statistical models.
