## Intro

I am a PostDoc Fellow in Statistics at Yale-NUS, Singapore.
My research interests include both the methodological and applied aspects of Statistics,
particularly within the Bayesian framework.
One of my main interests is Bayesian nonparametrics (BNP), and the use of flexible mixture
models for inference in scenarios where the data present peculiar features. In my recent
works, I focus on modelling data presenting deviation from Gaussianity and a sparse
dependency structure, group-specific dependencies, as well as the flexible inclusion covariate of
mixed types in the model.
